# scalePhone
GTAPhone for FiveM, using scaleforms.

## Purpose
Phone will be designed to handle the following:
* Contacts: Both players and "bots". Player contacts can be called or messaged. Bot contacts can be called to do special tasks.
* Emails: Emails will act as a global communication. Emails can be created by admins (or players in special situations) and they will be sent to everyone.
* Snapmatic: Photo app, connected to FiveM Snapmatic.
* Generic Custom Menu apps: Apps created dynamically, with menus that trigger different, easily configurable events.
